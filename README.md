A repository refresher.
The purpose of this repository is to refresh my GitSkills. I sometimes forget how to do things I've previously learned, but I often know how to get those skills back.
Oops, I didn't read all of the instructions before commiting that last edit. I forgot that I'm supposed to name the commits. I usually would do this in the terminal, so working through GitHub is actually new to me.
